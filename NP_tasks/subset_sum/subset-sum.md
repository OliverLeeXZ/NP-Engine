## Description
The subset sum problem asks whether a subset of numbers adds up to a given target. In this variation, the goal is not just to find any solution, but one that uses as many numbers as possible.

Given a set of integers and a target value **T**, find a subset of the integers whose sum is exactly equal to **T**, and which contains **as many elements as possible**.

## Submission Format
Return an ordered list of **element indices** (no duplicates) in square brackets, such that:
* The sum of the corresponding values is exactly equal to the target **T**.
* The number of elements in the list is as large as possible among all valid subsets.
```
[1, 2, 4]
```
The listed indices must exist in the input array, and their corresponding values must sum to **T**.

## Example Input
```
{
  "target": 10,
  "numbers": {
    "0": 2,
    "1": 3,
    "2": 7,
    "3": 8,
    "4": 5
  }
}
```

## Example Output
```
Answer: [0, 1, 4]
